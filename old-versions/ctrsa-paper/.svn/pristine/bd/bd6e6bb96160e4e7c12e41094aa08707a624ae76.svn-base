\begin{abstract} \label{astract}

Recently, a standard lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism has been shown to have promising performance on FPGA. The cryptographic scheme, named FrodoKEM, is one of many candidates for NIST's call for post-quantum standardisation. This research proposes optimised designs for FrodoKEM, concentrating on high throughput by paralleling the matrix multiplication operations within the scheme. This process is eased by the use of a much smaller and faster PRNG. The parallelisations proposed also complement the addition of first-order masking to the decapulation module. Overall, we significantly increase the throughput of FrodoKEM with relatively small increases in FPGA area consumption.
