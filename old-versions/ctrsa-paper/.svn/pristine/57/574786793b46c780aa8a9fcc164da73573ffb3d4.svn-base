\section{Background and Related Work} \label{sec:related}

FrodoKEM~\cite{frodokem} is a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the original standard lattice problem Learning With Errors (LWE)~\cite{Regev05}. FrodoKEM is a family of IND-CCA secure KEMs, the structure of which is based on a key exchange variant FrodoCCS~\cite{frodoccs}. FrodoKEM comes with two parameter sets FrodoKEM-640 and FrodoKEM-976, a summary of which is shown in Table \ref{tab:params}. FrodoKEM encapsulation is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:encaps}, the operations for which are fairly similar for key generation and decapsulation, expect decapsulation requires decoding of the message via the operation $\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{C} - \mathbf{B}'\mathbf{S}$. The most computationally heavy operation is Line 7, the LWE calculation, of two matrices $\mathbf{S}^\prime \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}^{\bar{m}\times n}$ and $\mathbf{A} \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}$, sampled from the error sampler and PRNG, respectively. The LWE instance is then completed by adding additional error from the error sampler. This is followed by a much smaller LWE operation, in which a random key is encoded. Finally, these ciphertexts are used to calculate a shared secret $(\mathbf{ss})$ via cSHAKE. The matrices generated use PRNGs, suggested by the authors, via AES or cSHAKE. The output of these algorithms have nice statistical properties, but the overhead required to achieve this is high.

%The security of FrodoKEM is comparable to the one of a brute force attack on AES-128, for FrodoKEM-640, and AES-192, for FrodoKEM-976. The main operations in FrodoKEM is LWE operations, shown in  Starting from a random seed, a public matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is generated. The matrix is generated using a suitable PRNG, suggested via AES or cSHAKE by the authors. The output of these algorithms have nice statistical properties, but the overhead required to achieve this is pretty high.

Naehrig et al. \cite{frodokem} report the results of the implementation on a 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 (with the best performance achieved by using OpenSSL AES implementation, that benefits from the NEON engine) and an Intel Core i7-6700 (x64 implementation using AVX2 and AES-NI instructions). Employing modular arithmetic ($q \leq 2^{16}$) results in using efficient and easy to implement single-precision
arithmetic. The sampling of the error term (16 bits per sample) is done by inversion sampling using a small LUT corresponds to the discrete cumulative density functions (CDT sampling).

There has been a number of software and hardware optimisations of FrodoKEM. Howe et al. \cite{howe2018standard} report both software and hardware designs for microcontroller and FPGA. The hardware design focuses on a plain implementation by using only one multiplier in order to fairly compare with previous work and the proposed software implementation. Due to their use of cSHAKE for PRNG, they have to pre-store a lot of the randomness into BRAM and then constantly update these values. Due to this, the implementations do not have the ability to increase the number of multipliers and uses large amounts of memory.

\subsection{Side-Channel Analysis}

In their call for proposals, NIST specified that algorithms which can be protected against side-channel attacks in an effective and efficient way are to be preferred \cite{nistsca}. To provide a whole picture about the performance of a candidate, it is thus important to evaluate also the cost of implementing ``standard'' countermeasures against these attacks.

In FrodoKEM specifications, cache and timing attacks can be mitigated using well known guidelines for implementing the algorithm. 
For timing attacks, these include to avoiding use of data derived from the secret to access the addresses and in conditional branches.
To counteract cache attacks it is necessary to ensure that all the operations depending on secrets are executed in constant-time.

Power analysis attacks can be addressed using masking. Masking is one of the most widespread and better understood techniques to protect
against passive side-channel attacks. In its most basic form, a mask is drawn uniformly from random and added to the secret. The resulting masked value, which is effectively a one-time-pad, and the mask are jointly called \emph{shares}: if taken
singularly they are statistically independent from the secret, and they must be combined to obtain the secret back. Any operation that previously involved the secret has to be turned into an operation over its shares. As long as they are not combined, any leakage from them will be statistically independent of the secret too. In our context, we show how masking can easily applied to FrodoKEM at a very low cost. We therefore argue the overhead that a protected implementation of Frodo in hardware incurs is minimal, hence making it a strong candidate when side-channel analysis are a concern. The reason behind this is that the only operation using the secret matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is the computation of the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ as $\mathbf{C} - \mathbf{B}'\mathbf{S}$ during decapsulation. When $\mathbf{S}$ is split in two (or more) shares using addition modulo $q$, the above multiplication by $\mathbf{B}'$ can be simply applied to both shares independently. Results are then subtracted by $\mathbf{C}$ one-by-one, so that computations never depend on both
shares simultaneously.
