\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The main contributions of this research is to evaluate the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism and potential NIST post-quantum standard, FrodoKEM \cite{frodokem}, in hardware. We develop designs which can reach up to 825 operations per second, where most of the designs fit in under 1500 slices. We significantly improve on previous research by Howe et al. \cite{howe2018standard} by increasing the number of parallel multipliers we use during matrix multiplication. In order to do this efficiently, we replace the inefficient PRNG previously used, cSHAKE, with a much faster and smaller PRNG, Trivium. This means we are able to attain significantly higher throughput efficiency compared to previous research. We also implement all designs in constant-time and illustrate that first-order masking for decapsulation can be achieved with almost no effect on performance. This masking is provided as demonstrative as we do not give power traces. 

The results show that FrodoKEM is an ideal candidate for hardware designs, showing potential for high-throughput performances whilst still maintaining relatively small FPGA area consumption. Moreover, compared to other NIST lattice-based candidates, it has a lot more flexibility, such as increasing throughput without completely re-designing the multiplication component, compared to, for example, a NTT multiplier.
