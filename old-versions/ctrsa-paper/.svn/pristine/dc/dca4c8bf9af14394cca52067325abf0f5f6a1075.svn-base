%%%%% masking discussion

Masking is one of the most widespread and better understood techniques to protect
against passive side-channel attacks. In its most basic form, a mask is drawn
uniformly from random and added to the secret. The resulting masked value, which is
effectively a one-time-pad, and the mask are jointly called \emph{shares}: if taken
singularly they are statistically independent from the secret, and they must be
combined to obtain the secret back. Any operation that previously involved the secret
has to be turned into an operation over its shares. As long as they are not combined,
any leakage from them will be statistically independent of the secret too. In our
context, we show how masking can easily applied to FrodoKEM at a very low cost. We
therefore argue the overhead that a protected implementation of FrodoKEM in hardware
is minimal, hence making it a strong candidate when side-channel analysis are a
concern.
