\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The main contributions of this research is to evaluate the lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism and potential NIST post-quantum standard, FrodoKEM \cite{frodokem}, in hardware. We develop designs which can reach up to 825 operations per second, where most of the designs fit in under 1500 slices. We significantly improve the state of the art by increasing the number of parallel multipliers we use during matrix multiplication. In order to do this efficiently, we replace the inefficient PRNG previously used, cSHAKE, with a much faster and smaller PRNG, Trivium. Thanks to this, we are able to attain significantly higher throughput efficiency compared to previous research. Our implementations also need constant computational time. To further evaluate the performance of FrodoKEM, we implemented first-order masking for decapsulation, and we showed that it can be achieved with almost no effect on performance.

The results show that FrodoKEM is an ideal candidate for hardware designs, showing potential for high-throughput performances whilst still maintaining relatively small FPGA area consumption. Moreover, compared to other NIST lattice-based candidates, it has a lot more flexibility, such as increasing throughput without completely re-designing the multiplication component, compared to, for example, a NTT multiplier.
